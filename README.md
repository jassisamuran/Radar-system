## Installation
To simply start project we have to run live server on vscode

## Prerequisites
- A web browser to view and interact with the radar system.
- Internet connection to load external libraries and resources.

## Usage
This project is basically mathematical project is used to locate the point on 2d plain and draw a concentrial circle around it like a object. and we can can enter a points and it tell us about that the point lies in range of that circle or not and if we wants to find any information between 2 points like slope,angle,distance and midpoint .we can also see where is more traffic in 2d plain.

## Features
This is used to find the relation between 2 points like slope,distance,midpoint and angle. it also automatically gives names to points.when we delete points it automatically reallocates names own.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the radar system interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the radar system.
- `scripts.js`: JavaScript file for interactive functionality.
- `jquery.min.js`, `popper.min.js`, and `bootstrap.min.js`: External libraries for Bootstrap components.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to all my teaches who inspires to think out of box.
